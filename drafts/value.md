# The Value of DevRel

## Direct contact with the developers using your tools

DevRels are part of the community. They're in the conversation, so you hear about things first-hand.

## User Zero

The first person to try something who didn't actually work on building it.

## Shape the conversation

You can never control the conversation, but a great devrel will contribute  to the ecosystem's overall discourse in a way that has the capability to influence the community zeitgeist.

## Two-way communication between the community and the product team

DevRel is a community member first, and an employee second. An active community member will hear what developers are struggling with and bring that directly back to the product team to inform and refine the roadmap.
