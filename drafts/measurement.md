# How to Measure DevRel

## Top of funnel

This is pretty coarse measurement because a lot of things influence the top of the funnel, but an effective devrel will have a measurable impact on new user signups.

## Monthly Active Developers

An effective devrel will not only bring new users to the platform, but continually create interest in the product that results in developers using it. Done properly, this results in Monthly Active Developers (MAD) increasing.

If possible, determine what actions within the product indicate higher engagement (e.g. "logging in" is baseline; "reviewing logs" is higher engagement). Use this engagement score to categorize MAD and track the growth across all levels of engagement.

## Feature activation

If the devrel team is working to raise awareness and adoption of a feature of the product, there should be measurable impact on the usage of that feature. Any increased usage is good, but looking at new user activation of the feature is a particularly good metric for devrel to own.

## Share of voice on social media

So much of the developer ecosystem is influenced by the small group that's highly active on social media. An effective devrel team will create [[Constant, gentle pressure|constant, gentle pressure]] through their efforts to ensure that the conversation includes your company, tool, and/or concepts.

## Earned media

The best devrels are [[content creator creators]]. A single person can only scale so far â€” and even if they're incredibly prolific, there's a point at which they reach saturation in the community and won't make additional impact through higher volume. This means that the most effective devrels not only create content, but enable and encourage developers in the ecosystem around them to create content about key subjects.

Measuring how many pieces were created about target topics by non-employee community members helps prove how impactful the devrel team has been at expanding the company's influence beyond its full-time team members.
