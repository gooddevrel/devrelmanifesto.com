# Principles of DevRel

## Do it for the culture

The best devrels put the community before the business. This might seem counterintuitive, but if you're not looking after the developer community first, you won't be welcome in the community for long.

If you can't find a way to reconcile two questions:

1. How does this help the community?
2. How does this help the company?

Then whatever you're considering is probably not a good project to pursue.

## Give more than you get

DevRel is all about relationships. A relationship where someone only shows up when they need something is not a healthy relationship. A relationship where someone will only help someone if it means they have a favor to cash in later is not a healthy relationship.

Approach devrel from an abundance mindset. Give freely and often, and don't expect anything explicitly in return. Choosing generosity and support as your default mode builds good will, and that creates positive word of mouth, strong connections, and a general willingness to help in the community.

## DevRel is a long game

Trust takes years to build, and a single bad interaction to destroy. An effective devrel doesn't take shortcuts or try to "growth hack" — those techniques work in the short term, but have extremely high risk of backfiring and undermining community trust.

Show up every day, leave the community better than you found it, and remember that the only sustainable success is the one that brings the ecosystem up with you.

## [[Don't start a cult]]

It is _really_ tempting to start a cult in devrel. It's easy to frame competing companies as "the enemy" and to try and create an insular community that holds using your tool as not just better, but morally superior.

As someone gains notoriety, it's even more tempting to create a cult of personality where it's more about creating an inner circle than it is about helping the broader community.

Cults divide people. They also — quite famously — tend to end poorly. 

You can win without other people losing

One of the greatest things about working in tech is that there are millions of developers and hundreds of billions of dollars in the market — we can all reach dizzying heights of success without ever needing to "defeat" another company.

Competition is healthy when it means companies putting in the work to create value for the community. When it turns into trying to "kill" competitors, you've lost the plot. We can all win. There's no need for anyone to lose.

## Build useful things

Hello world demos are fine, but effective devrels focus on building things that are useful to their community. What's the primary pain point your product is intended to solve? Build something that solves it to show developers how to do it.

## Share a point of view ("best practices")

There's a reason that seasoned developers always respond with "it depends", but that doesn't mean a devrel should avoid having opinions.

Developers — especially those who don't spend all their time on social media — are often searching for an experienced voice to share an established happy path (they describe this as searching for "best practices"). An effective devrel will have a clearly formed opinion and will create clear, authoritative guidance to provide developers with "best practices" for strategically valuable use cases.

## Pay attention to what's happening around you

Part of being helpful means noticing when and where you can help. Join the communities where developers you can help hang out. Put alerts on key topics or phrases so you can keep track of what's happening in the conversation. 

## Bring a whole person to the job

The most effective devrels have a personality that they share. Their interests are woven into conversations, demos, presentations, and more, which paints a more complete picture of who they are — this makes it easier to connect with them. It also makes them more resilient because they're not fully reliant on whatever tech they're currently teaching.

## Don't make this your whole personality

People who only talk about their jobs are boring. Don't be boring.

## Remember that you're not a fucking celebrity

[[“Being a famous developer is like being a famous plumber. Nobody really cares.”]] An effective devrel recognizes that having a large audience is _job security_, not _fame_. Don't expect or demand special treatment. Don't be weird.

## Embrace whatever makes you remarkable

Some devrels are funny. Some are really good at demos. Some have a knack for analogies.

Whatever your strength is, lean into it. [[“In relationships, you should spend your energy improving your weaknesses. In business, you should delegate your weaknesses and spend your energy playing to your strengths.”]] —[[Phil Caravaggio]]

## Rely on established formats most of the time

If every project needs to be built from first principles, you're wasting a _lot_ of energy and time. And worse, you're asking your audience to spend more energy figuring out whether or not the thing you've created is for them.

Creating a column, or series, or other repeatable format has enormous benefits:

- The only thing that needs to be created is the content itself, rather than the format, structure, medium, and other meta-work
- The audience becomes familiar with the voice and tone of the format and has decided "this is for me" — they can even subscribe

Leaning into repeatable formats reduces the cognitive effort required both to create _and_ to consume the end result.

## Experiment and play

Tech is a noisy place. Find opportunities to try something new: play with formats, try new media, borrow ideas from communities outside tech, collaborate with other devrels, and otherwise look for chances to play.

Exploration is how we push the field forward.

## Learn to find the joy in learning

The happiest people I know are joyfully curious. Unknowns are fun puzzles to solve together with friends. The process of learning itself becomes the reward, and each lesson learned is deliberate practice in learning itself.

DevRel is a job that is reactive by definition. You're paid to drink from the firehose of one of the most rapidly evolving ecosystems in existence. If you can't find the joy in learning about how the tools are changing, you _will_ burn out.

## DevRel is not a job title; it's how you interact with the community

Many of the most effective devrels today would probably argue with me if I called them devrels. DevRel, at the bottom of everything, is about more than just action — it's about the "why" behind the action.

The best devrels understand that the best path to success is to make everyone around you as successful as possible. That way you have a bunch of people in your corner who hold positions of power. Genuinely, earnestly helping the community succeed is how the biggest impacts are made.
