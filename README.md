# The DevRel Manifesto

A collective attempt to define some standards for developer relations.

As demand for developer relations (devrel) grows, we're feeling the immaturity of this field. The role is not well defined. There's not an established career ladder. We don't have decades of precedent to reference. Put bluntly: we're making this shit up as we go along.

This is a blessing and a curse. We're free to experiment and adapt, and that's a good thing. But there's also a lot of room for snake oil and bad incentives and "three marketing jobs in a trenchcoat (hoodie)", and that's not great.

So let's talk about devrel a bit. Not to stifle anyone's creativity or to try and fit the folks in this role into a tidy box, but to help create a shared understanding of what the value of devrel is, how it impacts businesses and communities, and what devrel should _not_ be.
